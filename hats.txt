Surely, to be a great specialist you need to wear all the hats from
the video. Especially futurist hat, because it combines all the
others. And I would like to try all of them (except from writer's hat,
I don't like that). However, at the moment, I feel that I would like
to try anthropologist's hat the most, because I want to know what
people need and want to have and how to make it as much usable, simple
and accesible for them.
